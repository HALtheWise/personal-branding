# Hi, I'm Eric Miller

### I'm an engineer at Olin College with a passion for solving hard problems, taming complex systems, and changing the world.

This repository contains files and documentation that I have put together to record
and remember who I am, primarily so I can share that information with the world. 

Toward that end, this repository contains things like...
* My resume
* Documentation for completed projects
* Pictures of things I have done and made

This repository also contains a fair bit of information under `internal/` not directly intended for external consumption.
Feel free to poke around, but assume you are not the target audience for anything found there.
